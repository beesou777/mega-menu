In addition to abolishing exploitative child labor, the new GoodWeave standard also considers social and environmental criteria for certified rugs. This is supported and promoted by well-known development services such as UNICEF, Bread for the World, Misereor, terre des hommes, the German Society for Technical Cooperation, or the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. The holistic concept also includes compliance with dignified working hours and environmental standards, safe and hygienic working conditions, as well as the possibility of education for former child laborers.

Intensive campaigns against the use of child labor were set as the goal. To avoid the negative consequences of illegal child labor for the workers, exporters, and carpet manufacturing regions, positive solutions were required. Together with UNICEF and the German-Indian Export Promotion Project (IGEP) of the German Society for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), the RUGMARK system was developed. Meanwhile, RUGMARK is a trademark-protected certification that assures importers and buyers that the carpet was made by a company committed to working without illegal child labor and is subject to an effective monitoring mechanism.

BenefitsGuaranteeContent1Text="MORGENLAND® sees itself as a globally operating representative of high-quality carpet products that exclusively appeal to almost any ambiance. Here, brand quality meets exquisite and hand-knotted floor coverings, as if from a tale from one thousand and one nights. The old country-specific weaving art of European productions can already be culturally and developmentally distinguished from the flat weavings of Oriental carpets. Persian carpets are part of the world's cultural heritage and consistently achieve price increases as collector's items. Thus, the most expensive carpet in the world to date, an antique Persian carpet named 'Clark Sichelblatt' from the 17th century, was auctioned for a remarkable 34 million euros. The most well-known German carpet is also from the same time period, namely the 'Kerman Vasenteppich'. Here, the traditionally patterned differences of various fabrics are already evident, reflecting individual eras and styles like paintings within the visual arts. Whether it's the flying carpet from Aladdin's magic lamp, the Golden Fleece, or Penelope, who meticulously performs her weaving art, the carpet always takes center stage in our lives."

BenefitsGuaranteeContent4Title="Direct Purchase From the Seller"
BenefitsGuaranteeContent4Text="MORGENLAND® also wants to convey the fascination of high-quality rugs to you, our customers. In addition to a huge selection of cultural-historical witnesses from the expanses of the Orient, you have various rugs and patterns available, from modern wool rugs to nomadic woven rugs to fascinating unique pieces. This starts with the selection of high-quality materials, which fundamentally distinguishes natural materials from synthetic fibers. With the necessary quality work, high-quality materials such as sisal, hemp, cotton, jute, or natural hair are processed into a net and fabric that is second to none in a wall hanging. In fact, wall hangings were used for such decorative purposes in the past. However, experience has shown that weaving technique does the most creative work here. Whether machine-made, hand-knotted, or woven, in the end, for handmade goods, the knot density per square meter is particularly important. This so-called La value is lower the finer and denser the fabric is knotted. This in turn speaks for the quality of the handmade rug. When buying directly from the dealer"

We give you the opportunity to have your own company logo on the carpet or to create a individually designed wall tapestry."
B2bContractTitle = "Carpets for Business, a Benchmark of High Quality"
B2bContractBody = "Just as the flooring of a commercial enterprise must meet different requirements than that of private customers, the same applies to carpets. Floor coverings are qualitatively sorted into usage classes and abrasion classes to predefine surface and material properties for commercial, private, and industrial use. This also takes into account the manufacturer's warranties, which advertise the durability of their product. Similar expectations are placed on a business carpet, but with different quality criteria."
B2bRightCarpetTitle = "The Dilemma of Choice: The Right Business Carpet"
B2bRightCarpetBody = "MORGENLAND TEPPICHE can provide you with a quote for a custom-designed carpet by calculating the costs. First, it is necessary to examine the type of carpet more closely. Should an entire corridor, a room, or an office be covered with carpet, you have the choice between various carpet products: the custom-sized carpet, the broadloom carpet, or carpet tiles. While broadloom and carpet tiles are suitable for installation in a corridor or an open office landscape, the custom-sized carpet is used for seating areas or as a central element in the room."
B2bCarpetShapeTitle = "Carpet Fibers, Shape, and Color: Quality that Makes a Difference"
B2bCarpetShapeBody = "The first impression convinces. With an excellent carpet fiber, almost any pattern and color combination can be realized. Design takes center stage when the interior is meant to interact harmoniously. Consequently, the carpet should match the sofa in the waiting room, the store's interior, or other commercial furnishings. MORGENLAND TEPPICHE is happy to advise you in this regard and can customize your carpet. This includes, for example, the possibility of integrating your company logo."
B2bCarpetBackingTitle = "The Carpet Backing: A Crucial Quality Marker for Business Carpets"
B2bCarpetBackingBody = "High-quality carpets leave a lasting impression not only visually but also with business customers. In addition to comfortable walking comfort, business carpets should have the appropriate quality seals, which scrutinize material properties regarding abrasion resistance, slip resistance, and fire resistance. Especially in heavily frequented areas, it is advantageous to use heat- and sound-insulating carpets. The reduced noise level gradually reduces acoustic loads, which also benefits your employees. The carpet backing plays a major role and can consist of felt, latex, or textile. These materials complement the carpet's quality and ensure it is always comfortable and joint-friendly. Individual special orders, for example in a reception hall, should have a certain degree of slip resistance. Individual items should therefore be examined and evaluated separately. We at MORGENLAND TEPPICHE are the right partner for this."
B2bChoicesBetweenTitle = "The Choice Always Stands Between Natural Fibers and Synthetic Fibers."
B2bChoicesBetweenBody = "Especially in commercial use, the quality of the product depends on the average length of the fiber and its purity. Whether woven, tufted, or machine-made, the robustness level of a business carpet should always be in focus. Typically, in business, cotton is used as a natural fiber, or a synthetic fiber like nylon or polyester is chosen. While cotton is very robust, elastic, and heat-resistant, synthetic fibers stand out, particularly for their stain resistance, high moisture resistance, and easy maintenance. No matter which material you choose, we are happy to help you find the right carpet that suits the style and character of your business. In this way, you will impress every customer."

AboutUsTitle="About Us"
AboutUsContent1Title="How Our Carpets Are Produced?"
AboutUsContent1Text="The story of Morgenland Carpets begins in the 20th century in Afghanistan. Originally founded as 'Carpets Madjidian' in Kabul, the family business quickly grew, expanding into wholesale with up to 200 weavers. Initially specializing in fine Afghan silk carpets, wool carpets from various regions were added later. The civil war led to closure, but in 1998, the family embarked on a new beginning in Germany. Nader Madjidian resumed his previous work. In 2007, the family established a new carpet company in Hamburg's Speicherstadt. Under the leadership of Kabir Madjidian, the eldest son, the company started selling on eBay. Initially locally sourced, purchasing expanded to countries like Persia and India. The entire production chain was taken over, and the first production began in India. Today, Morgenland Carpets is an established producer and marketer through its own webshop. With warehouses in Speicherstadt and a showroom in Hamburg, the company has grown."

;ManufacturingTypes------------------------------------------------

WovenCarpetTitle2 ="Tufting process"
WovenCarpetTitle3 ="Knotting technique"
WovenCarpetTitle4 ="Hand-knotted"
WovenCarpetTitle5 ="Hand-woven"
WovenCarpetTitle6 ="Patchwork"
WovenCarpetTitle7 ="Hand-tufted"
WovenCarpetBody1 = " Woven carpets have a smooth weave. The warp of cotton or linen yarn is completely covered by the wool weft. The threads lie flat and do not form a pile. The traditional loom has evolved over the centuries into the industrial machines of today."
WovenCarpetBody2 = " Today, the tufting process is more common than average. In tufting, carpets are made as if with a sewing machine. Hand tufting uses a single needle, whereas in machine processes many needles work in parallel. The tufting process is very fast. Tufted carpets are accordingly cheap."
WovenCarpetBody3 = "Carpets with a plush pile are made. Threads are knotted onto the warp and finished with weft threads at the end of the row of knots. After completion, the pile is trimmed evenly. The more knots per square metre a carpet has, the more valuable it is. Very high-quality pieces have up to one million knots per square metre."
WovenCarpetBody4 = "Hand-knotted carpets are traditionally made by nomads and farmers, but today they are also made in small ateliers and manufactories. When knotting, warp threads are first stretched on a knotting loom, into which the weft is woven crosswise. The result is a basic fabric into which the pile thread is now woven, knot by knot. Each completed weave is then secured with a metal comb. The finer the pile thread and the higher the knot density, the more valuable the carpet. Over the centuries, different types of knotting and knot shapes have evolved. Each region of origin also has its own patterns, colours and materials."
WovenCarpetBody5 = "Hand-woven carpets are traditionally crafted on a hand loom, resulting in a smooth weave usable on both sides. After stretching the cotton or linen warp threads on the loom, the woolen weft thread is woven crosswise using a shuttle. The carpet's fineness or coarseness depends on the wool's thickness and the number of warp threads. Compared to high-pile carpets, hand-woven ones are notably lighter. They can be plain or patterned, often featuring motifs of plants, animals, symbols, and signs symbolizing contentment and happiness."
WovenCarpetBody6 = "Patchwork or vintage carpets are artfully crafted from pieces of old, sometimes antique, Persian carpets. These pieces are hand-selected, cut, and sewn together. Special zig-zag seams and an additional backing enhance the carpet's stability and durability. Before processing, each carpet is meticulously cleaned. Colored vintage carpets undergo color neutralization and re-dyeing, giving them a modern appearance. Each patchwork carpet is unique. The term "vintage" in English denotes something classic and of high quality."
WovenCarpetBody7 = "Hand tufting is a semi-manual process for making high-quality pile carpets. Instead of stringing knots together, a special "tufting gun" is used to push the yarn through a stretched base pile.Once the pile is finished, the carpet is backed and sheared evenly or in relief. Hand-tufted carpets are durable, high quality and relatively inexpensive. The technique opens up unlimited scope for design."
